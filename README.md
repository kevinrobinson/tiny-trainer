### Development
This is static website, but it uses `node.js` for the build process.

In the project directory, you can run:

```
$ yarn install # install dependencies
$ yarn start # run build in development mode
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so that's a good place to learn more if you are trying to set it up yourself.
